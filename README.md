# What is this

My fourth React project during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a multi-page movie application**.

## How I started

I watch all the movies from this week and also a few extra on youtube. Then I made the site accordingly to the project guide. When I was done with that I started with changes. Such as giving the user the option to choose a director and see the movies they have directed or written. 

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

My big issue this week is that the site doesn't reload when I refresh it. I have tried a few different things and nothing seems to work. I'm hoping that I can get some help with that because I have no idea why it doesn't work or how to approach it.  

### What I'm proud of

I'm really proud if the design. I think it looks pretty cool and I've spent quite some time with the CSS-part of this project. 

## If I had more time

If I hade more time I would have done at least one of the deep dives.
